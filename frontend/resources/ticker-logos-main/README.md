# Stock Ticker Logos

These are not stock images, a lot have been customized such as cropping out icons from logos or changing dark font to white.

Mostly transparent logos for (almost) all NYSE & NASDAQ stock companies.

Some logos have been selected or modified to be white/lighter for our dark themed website. Some logos that weren't originally have been made transparent, resulting in some rough edges that aren't very notceable in our use-case; they are listed further below.
